# üñ•Ô∏è Step-by-Step Process for Handling a Security Alert

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Inspect Alerts in SIEM Dashboard
- Access your SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platform.
- Review active alerts generated by monitoring tools.
- Identify alerts related to suspicious or malicious activity.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Find the Malicious IP Address
- From the alert details, locate the source IP address responsible for triggering the alert.
- Example:
  ```
  Alert Type: Unauthorized Access Attempt
  Source IP: 203.0.113.45
  ```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Check Reputation of the IP Address
- Use threat intelligence platforms or public reputation checkers to verify the IP's reputation.
  - Suggested tools:
    - VirusTotal: https://www.virustotal.com/
    - AbuseIPDB: https://www.abuseipdb.com/
    - IPVoid: https://www.ipvoid.com/
- Example finding:
  ```
  IP: 203.0.113.45
  Status: Malicious
  Origin: China
  Activity: Brute Force Attempts Detected
  ```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Escalate to SOC Manager
- Notify your SOC Manager or Incident Response Team.
- Provide:
  - The IP address and reputation report
  - Alert details from the SIEM
  - Any supporting logs or evidence
- Recommended communication methods:
  - Ticketing system (e.g., Jira, ServiceNow)
  - Email summary with attachments
  - Direct verbal escalation if critical

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Implement a Firewall Block Rule
- Access the organization's firewall management interface.
- Create and apply a block rule to prevent traffic from the identified malicious IP.
- Example:
  ```
  Action: Block
  Source: 203.0.113.45
  Destination: Any
  Port/Protocol: Any
  Comment: Block malicious IP identified from SIEM alert
  ```
- Verify that the rule is active and properly blocking incoming traffic from the IP.
